### 1. ToeXhek - DSA Sorting Adventure Game
   - **Description**: A fun two-player number guessing game where Player 1 sets a secret 4-digit number, and Player 2 guesses it with feedback based on distance; at the end, guesses are sorted using five algorithms (Bubble, Insertion, Selection, Merge, Quick) with execution time comparisons, featuring a GTA-style dark theme, intro sequence, and persistent history in MySQL.
   - **Technologies Used**: Java 17+, Swing (GUI), MySQL + JDBC, Maven, JUnit 5 (testing).
   - **Key Learnings**: Implementing and comparing classic sorting algorithms for efficiency, building interactive GUIs with Swing and CardLayout, integrating database operations for game history persistence, and writing unit tests with JUnit.
